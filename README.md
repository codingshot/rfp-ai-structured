Using Open Ai Structured Output using Markdown templates  to write RFPs

Certainly! Here is a more specific example of what you might include in the `.env`, `.env.example`, and README files for the script that uses OpenAI's API to generate structured responses from a markdown template.

### **`.env` File**

This file contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control. It includes your OpenAI API key and any other configuration settings needed for the script to function.

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### **`.env.example` File**

This file serves as a template to show other developers what environment variables are required. It should be included in version control.

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

### **README.md**

Here's a README file tailored to the script described earlier:

```markdown
# Markdown Template Processor

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingshot/rfp-ai-structured/.git
   cd rfp-ai-structured
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install openai pydantic
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

## Usage

Run the script to process a markdown template:

```bash
python markdowntostructured.py
```

- **Markdown Template**: Modify the `markdown_template` variable in the script to change the input markdown.
- **Response**: The script will output the structured response according to the defined schema.

## Environment Variables

The script requires the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key. This is required to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.


# About Open AI Structured Outputs
OpenAI's Structured Outputs feature allows developers to ensure that model-generated responses adhere to a predefined JSON schema. This capability enhances the reliability and usability of AI-generated content by guaranteeing that outputs conform to specific structural requirements, addressing common challenges in AI-powered applications.

API Integration: Structured Outputs can be used via the OpenAI API by specifying the response_format parameter with your defined schema. This ensures that the model's output will conform to the schem
